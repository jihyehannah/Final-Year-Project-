0,1,1,1,1,"We've gone several times and don't speak that much Japanese. 90% of my vocabulary is food from ordering at Japanese restaurants. You will be able to travel easily around Tokyo and Osaka. Many signs are in Japanese and English. For language assistance, a smart phone with either a Japan sim or a reasonably priced overseas data plan is very important. And if you can, make sure you both have one. It's to keep you in contact with each other in case you get separated."

1,1,0,1,0,Second this! SG is making it hard for me to travel overseas without noticing how small and uneven pedestrian sidewalks are in other countries  especially when we carry our strollers everywhere.
2,2,0,2,1,When I was homeless I'd go up North like Canada for the summer months spend my winters in the keys mostly. I have people in Florida now that I met years ago that want me to come down so they can see how much I have changed and prospered. I am grateful and blessed that my online family on my platforms have accepted me as me. I talk often about my journeys being homeless. I traveled by box cars all over this country Canada Mexico and even to Alaska. My dream is to travel overseas one day
2,1,0,2,0,"All my travel is self-funded, so... I got a giggle when reading about the people who brought Crumbl Cookies to Australia to sell for $17 each at a fake ""pop-up"" shop, and it got me to thinking... What can I pack into my suitcase to sell at exorbitant prices to gullible people, to pay for my next trip overseas? Of course I'm kidding, but it just astounds me that people will line up for over an hour to buy a cookie, or a burger, or a whatever isn't available locally."
0,1,1,2,1,"Does anyone have any tips for month long overseas travel? The longest I've travelled is 2 weeks, is there much of a difference? I think I have covered all possible bases (insurance, vacuum packing, travel accessories, e-sim, apps etc). The majority of time is Europe with stops in Asia and the Middle East."
1,1,0,1,1,"Alhamdulillah all my overseas travels have been ok. I think the one that left bad taste for me was this island in Malaysia - it was off season so not many people there. The first place I stayed is a cheap old school motel, but it was dirty i immediately checked out at daylight despite already paid for a few more days; but when I checked into a more expensive resort style place, that place was not exactly very clean plus it spooked me out pulak (and I rarely get spooked) "
1,1,2,1,1,Thanks to my friends who celebrated my birthday in Barcelona a couple of times and allowed me to have so many wonderful moments.

1,1,0,2,0,"Taiwan-Macau-Hong Kong Adventure -April 2024This was a memorable family trip, as it was the 1st time I got to travel w hubby's fam. We indulged in cheap milk tea daily. BOBA?one cup every day! The food was incredibly cheap, nearly 50% less than what we usually pay in Dubai, making it a FOOD TRIP.However, I made the mistake of drinking less water bec I'm not a fan of using public restrooms. Ironically, as a nurse, I should have known better! Unfortunately, that decision caught up with me."
0,1,0,1,0,"Osaka is very safe and easy to travel. It's cheaper than Kyoto but directly connected by the Sakaisuji Metro line. Just get an IC card for public transportation at the Airport and use it in the whole country. When you come to rural Germany, do not rely on public transportation too much. Its very slow, only available in cities and also expensive. There is a cheap monthly ticket for the whole country available, but since it's a subscription you have to ask help from a local or hotel."
1,2,1,2,2,"Day 15: Travel Log Yesterday was a travel day, but here are some of the memories I've loved this far. I will never forget these poolside-mountainside views. Studying my Bible here and snapping pics of the girls and Milan were inspiring. Dinners and breakfasts with the family. Skimming through 3 novels on the plane. Meeting new friends that encourage my faith. It's been beautiful. One more week."
0,1,1,0,1,"Maybe will be best if you just planned the trip and pay for the sitting so you don't bother other people? I do it with my partner, we pay to sit together and same when my baby arrives. Is called planning. You canmt pretend make someone that has pay for their seat move for your bad planning. When travelling with kids you need to plan!"

2,1,0,2,2,"A quick leaf peeping trip to the Berkshires. Great Barrington Farmers' Market and a walk around town for some (mostly) window shopping. No leaf pics and our lunch plans shifted since it was super busy and a bit too peopley for Sophia, but we grabbed some warm cider donuts from Taft Farms to bring home. "
1,2,1,0,0,Some shots from the recent trip to Charlotte. Didn't have much time to take photos like I usually do because of our tight schedule. What a trip though. We ran in and slayed the video shoots everyday covering the 2 day Built national event with the team. Probably captured a couple terabytes of footage easy.

1,1,1,1,2,"You can make your own itinerary naman. Spot hiking destinations in your area or join an active lifestyle community. But if you're introvert like me or maybe you do not know how to start, hiking or freediving (if there are available in your area) are best start-ups where you can join solo. Look for organizers for the trip, surely they will help and guide you. "

1,0,1,2,0,"I think what's key about this is intention- You can travel AND get cute pics for your feed, but there are also people who solely go to a spot just to take a pic, smile, then instantly frown as soon as the camera is gone. I'll never go to a nice spot JUST to take pictures- there are places where people wait 4 hours just to take pics  i'd rather spend time experiencing the place I'm visiting, capture moments I don't want to forget, & take a few pics to help maintain consistent content"
1,2,0,1,0,"Yeah I probably should have specified! I have zero experience. My budget is not very high lol so honestly just the least expensive you can recommend. I'm really just looking to take photos when I travel.. like landscapes, architecture, people, things like that.

2,1,1,2,1,"On a whim, we decided to cancel our flight back to Copenhagen and take an impromptu detour in Germany by train.  I can't remember the last time we didn't plan a whole trip and were not constrained to a tight schedule. I'm entering a new chapter in my life as an artist.

Solo Travel, decision making, spontaneity, alone time, expressing yourself without having to consider someone else; (clothing, lifestyle,hobbies) if you have kids your career is over' you sacrifice a lot of yourself to be married.

1,1,0,1,1,"Travelling by Bus in Tanzania  By far one of my favourite ways to travel. The whole experience was like nothing I had ever experienced with public transportation and I loved it. They would have TV screens playing either music, or films (in Swahili) I got obsessed with so many new songs from this. Some of the buses would get packed and people would be standing or sitting in the aisle for 4+ hours! But the views' Tanzania blew me away every time I looked out of the window."
